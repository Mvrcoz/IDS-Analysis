# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) Analysis
**Objective**: Set up and monitored network traffic for threats using Security Onion, Sguil, and Squert.

## Tools Used
- **Security Onion**: Platform for network security monitoring.
- **Zenmap**: Visual network scanning.
- **Squert**: Tool for visualizing IDS alerts.

## Key Concepts
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Distinguishes between network-based (NIDS) and host-based (HIDS) systems.
- **Alert Monitoring**: Analyzing alerts from traffic scans to detect vulnerabilities.

## Lab Overview
1. **Network Scans**: Conducted using Zenmap for port identification.
2. **Traffic Analysis**: Used Squert to monitor and filter network traffic for security threats.

## Learnings
- Learned IDS fundamentals and practical monitoring techniques.
- Hands-on experience with tools for real-time security event detection.
